## Key Features
### 1.Data Cleaning and Preparation : 
1. Handling missing values
2. Renaming columns for consistency
3. Converting data types for better processing.

### 2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
1. Analysis of pricing trends across different locations
2. Insights into room types and their availability
3. Identification of popular listings based on reviews and occupancy.

### 3. Visualization:
1. Charts and graphs to illustrate key insights.
2. Histograms for price distributions.
3. Bar charts for room type comparisons.

### 4. Insights:
1. Average price by neighborhood.
2. Seasonal trends in booking patterns.
3. Most reviewed and highly-rated listings.

## Tools and Libraries Used:
1. Python: Core programming language for data analysis.
2. Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
3. Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
4. Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for combining code, visualizations, and narrative text.
5. Kaggle : To use the AirBnB Listings & Reviews Dataset .

# Final Insights
1. Since the launch, the number of AirBnBs has increased, and prices have increased, too, due to initial traction and early adopters.
2. After the Startup is known to everyone and becomes a common utility, the number of AirBnBs starts increasing, and prices also keep decreasing.
3. After regulations were announced around 2015, there was underconfidence in the business; the number of AirBnBs started decreasing and prices started increasing.
4. Once the regulation became the new normal, during the year 2019, the number of AirBnBs increased, and prices kept decreasing due to more supply of them.

# Recommnedation for AirBnB-
1. Regulation in long-term rentals can impact the business adversely; there might be customer churn due to uncertainty.
2. Such regulations might add to AirBnB losses, which might be difficult to recover later.
3. If the customer experience is going to get impacted due to this, it would lead to incorrect brand perception.
4. It is recommended to watch for any such regulation in other places and be prepared for it.
5. AirBnB can replicate such a regulation in other places.
6. They can keep strict rules to onboard and release the hosts.
7. They can limit the number of AirBnBs in a locality to ensure the public has enough rental options and the government doesn't step in.
